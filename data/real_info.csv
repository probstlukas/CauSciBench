Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment,"The randomized experiment aims to analyze the effect of different types of social pressures on voter behavior. A field experiment was conducted in Michigan ahead of the August 2006 primary election. Households were randomly assigned to a control group or one of four treatment groups: Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Self, Neighbors. Eleven days before the election, each treatment group received a different mailing: Civic Duty: Emphasized the recipient's responsibility as a citizen to vote. Hawthorne: Notified recipients that their voting behavior would be studied using public records, introducing mild social pressure. Self: Listed the voting history of all registered voters in the household and noted that an updated chart would be mailed after the election. Neighbors: Included both the household's and neighbors' voting records, implying public exposure of voting behavior. Control Group: Received no mailing.

Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks' Interests: A Field Experiment Manipulating Political Incentives,"This data is from a randomized field experiment in which fictional emails, appearing to come from Black constituents, were sent to legislators across the United States. The purpose was to test whether being outside a legislator's district reduced the likelihood of receiving a response, and whether Black legislators were more likely to respond regardless of electoral incentives. The main focus is on differences in responsiveness based on the race of the legislator and the sender's eligibility to vote.

Government Transfers and Political Support,"The data focuses on the Uruguayan Plan de Atencion Nacional a la Emergencia Social (PANES), described as a large, temporary social relief program. PANES ran from April 2005 to December 2007. PANES included several components. The main part was a monthly cash transfer. Eligibility for the PANES program was determined using a predicted income score. This score was based on household socioeconomic characteristics collected during a baseline survey. Households were eligible only if their predicted income score fell below a predetermined threshold.

Similarly, a ""field in the lab"" experiment run on actual organ donor registration decisions finds no increase in registrations resulting from an active choice frame.

"The Demand for, and Impact of, Learning Hiv Status.","This dataset comes from a randomized field experiment conducted in rural Malawi between May and August 2004, as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The MDICP is a long-term study involving approximately 120 villages across three districts: Rumphi, Mchinji, and Balaka. As part of the program, respondents were offered a free HIV test administered at home. To encourage participants to collect their test results, they were randomly given vouchers of varying value, redeemable at nearby voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers. Voucher amounts were determined by drawing tokens from a bag. Researchers then recorded whether participants retrieved their results from the assigned VCT center. Variables: site: Region of Malawi where the study was conducted (1 = Mchinji, 2 = Balaka, 3 = Rumphi); rumphi: Indicator for living in Rumphi district; balaka: Indicator for living in Balaka district; villnum: Village ID; survey2004: Indicator for completing the 2004 baseline survey; got: Indicator for whether the respondent obtained their HIV test result; zone: Identifier for the VCT center assigned to the respondent; distvct: Distance (in kilometers) to the assigned VCT center; tinc: Total incentive value in Malawi Kwacha; Ti: Discrete incentive level category (e.g., 0; 10-50; 60-100; 110-200; 210-300 Malawi Kwacha); any: Indicator for receiving a positive-valued incentive; under: Indicator for living within 1.5 km of the assigned VCT center; over: Indicator for living more than 1.5 km from the assigned VCT center; simaverage: Simulated average distance to a VCT center (based on randomly drawn household locations); age: Respondent's age in 2004; male: Indicator for male respondents; hiv2004: HIV test result in 2004 (-1 indicates indeterminate result)",Does providing monetary incentives lead individuals to obtain their HIV test results?,0.31,0.026,1,ols,any,got,"male, tinc, hiv2004, age, rumphi, balaka",,,,,1,,,thornton_hiv.csv,Table 4 (2),2008,economics,MIT,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/causaldata/index.html,https://mixtape.scunning.com/09-difference_in_differences,,,,"@article{thornton_hiv,

Do Voters Affect or Elect Policies: Evidence from the U.S. House,"This dataset is used to study whether elected officials moderate their policy positions in response to closely contested elections. The goal is to test whether policy outcomes reflect the preferences of a nearly divided electorate (convergence) or the ideology of the winning candidate (divergence).

Minimum Wages and Employment:A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,"The dataset was collected to examine the effects of a minimum wage increase on fast food employment. It includes two survey waves from 410 fast food restaurants such as Burger King, KFC, Wendy's, and Roy Rogers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The first wave took place just before the April 1992 wage increase, and the second occurred seven to eight months later. The survey gathered information on employment, wages, prices, store characteristics, and location. Data collection involved phone interviews. The fast food sector was selected for its high share of low-wage jobs, standardization, and compliance with wage laws. The variables are: sheet: unique store identifier; chain: chain identifier (1 = Burger King, 2 = KFC, 3 = Roy Rogers, 4 = Wendy's); co_owned: 1 if the store is company-owned, 0 otherwise; state: 1 if the store is in New Jersey, 0 if in Pennsylvania; after: 1 if the data was collected after an increase in minimum wage, 0 otherwise; fte: number of full time employees; southj: 1 if the store is in southern New Jersey; centralj: 1 if the store is in central New Jersey; northj: 1 if the store is in northern New Jersey; pa1: 1 if the store is in northeast suburbs of Philadelphia; pa2: 1 if the store is in Easton or nearby areas in Pennsylvania; shore: 1 if the store is on the New Jersey shore; ncalls: number of callbacks before completing the first interview; empft: number of full-time employees (first interview); emppt: number of part-time employees (first interview); nmgrs: number of managers or assistant managers (first interview); wage_st: starting wage in dollars per hour (first interview); inctime: months until usual first raise (first interview); firstinc: amount of usual first raise in dollars per hour (first interview); bonus: 1 if the store offers a cash bonus for new workers; pctaff: percent of employees affected by the new minimum wage; meals: code for meal benefits (0 = none, 1 = free, 2 = reduced price, 3 = both); open: hour the store opens (first interview); hrsopen: number of hours the store is open per day (first interview); psoda: price of a medium soda, including tax (first interview); pfry: price of small fries, including tax (first interview); pentree: price of an entree including tax (first interview); nregs: number of cash registers in the store (first interview); nregs11: number of registers open at 11:00 am (first interview); type2: mode of second interview (1 = phone, 2 = personal); status2: status of second interview (0 = refused, 1 = answered, 2-5 = closed for various reasons); date2: date of second interview (mmddyy format); ncalls2: number of callbacks before completing the second interview; empft2: number of full-time employees (second interview); emppt2: number of part-time employees (second interview); nmgrs2: number of managers or assistant managers (second interview); wage_st2: starting wage in dollars per hour (second interview); inctime2: months until usual first raise (second interview); firstin2: amount of usual first raise in dollars per hour (second interview); special2: 1 if the store has a special program for new workers (second interview); meals2: code for meal benefits (second interview; same coding as meals); open2r: hour the store opens (second interview); hrsopen2: number of hours the store is open per day (second interview); psoda2: price of a medium soda, including tax (second interview); pfry2: price of small fries, including tax (second interview); pentree2: price of an entree including tax (second interview); nregs2: number of cash registers in the store (second interview); nregs112: number of registers open at 11:00 am (second interview)",Did an increase in minimum wage decrease employment?,2.75,1.69,0,did,state,fte,,,post,,,0,,,min_wage_data.csv,Table 3,1992,economics,GPL,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wooldridge/wooldridge.pdf,https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/data_sets.html,,,Added the column post and fte,"techreport{NBERw4509,

Markets: The Fulton Fish Market,"The dataset was collected from the Fulton Fish Market, a historic wholesale fish market in New York City. The purpose of the data collection was to examine the economic and institutional dynamics of how the market functioned. Fish were sold in bulk to a wide range of buyers, including restaurants, retail shops, and independent vendors. Transactions typically took place in the early morning hours, with prices and quantities influenced by factors such as day of the week, weather conditions, and supply levels. Sales were higher on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, compared to Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Sellers in the market set prices individually for each customer. The dataset focuses specifically on whiting, a commonly traded fish in the market. Price information was gathered directly through daily visits to the market and from reports provided by salesmen. Variables: mon: 1 if the day is Monday, 0 otherwise; tu: 1 if the day is Tuesday, 0 otherwise; wed: 1 if the day is Wednesday, 0 otherwise; thu: 1 if the day is Thursday, 0 otherwise; date: Date in Year Month Day format; stormy: whether or not the weather was stormy; 1 if stormy, 0 otherwise; mixed: 1 if the weather was mixed, 0 otherwise; p: logarithm of the price per pound; q: logarithm of the total quantity sold in pounds; rainy: 1 if the weather was rainy, 0 otherwise; cold: 1 if the weather was cold, 0 otherwise; wind: wind speed",What is the effect of fish prices on quantity demanded?,-1.12,0.43,1,iv,q,p,"mon, tue, wed, thu",,,stormy,,0,,,fulton.csv,Table 2,2006,economics,MIT,https://github.com/scunning1975/mixtape,,,,,"@article{graddy_markets,

Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving,"This dataset contains administrative records from the state of Washington related to driving under the influence (DUI) incidents. Washington State uniformly enforced a legal BAC limit of 0.08 for DUI offenses. The BAC values are obtained from tests conducted by the state police using breathalyzers. Drivers under the legal drinking age were excluded from the analysis, as they are subject to different legal standards. Besides BAC values, the dataset includes demographic information about the driver and recidivism, which indicates if the person was charged with a DUI offense again. Variables: date: date when the BAC test occurred; alcohol1: alcohol level from the first test; alcohol2: alcohol level from the second test; low_score: lower score between alcohol1 and alcohol2; male: indicator for the driver's gender; 1 if male, 0 otherwise; white: indicator for the driver's race; 1 if white, 0 otherwise; recidivism: indicator for whether the driver was stopped again for suspected DUI within a specified follow-up period; 1 if yes, 0 if no; acc: indicator for whether the original DUI stop involved a vehicle accident; 1 if yes, 0 if no; age: age of the driver at the time of the DUI stop; year: calendar year in which the DUI stop occurred; bac1: BAC value at the time of the test",Does receiving a DUI conviction (BAC >= 0.08) reduce the likelihood of future drunk driving compared to those just below the legal limit?,-0.021,0.004,1,rdd,,recidivism,"male, white, year, age",bac,,,,0,,,hansen.csv,,2015,economics,MIT,https://github.com/scunning1975/mixtape,,,,,"@article{hansen_punishment,

Public Trust and Collaborative Governance: An Instrumental Variable Approach,"The dataset comes from a pre-registered vignette experiment examining the effect of trust in government on perceived collaborative governance in a hypothetical environmental program. Respondents were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: Corrupt, Control, and Honest, about government integrity in a fictional U.S. city, Midtown. The information provided to the corrupt group explicitly states that the (hypothetical) municipality has corrupt officials. Similarly, for the honest group, the information states that officials are not corrupt. The control group is provided with no information. After reading the information about government integrity, subjects reported trust in government, perceptions of collaborative governance, and willingness to coproduce public services. Variables: trust: Trust in government (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); private: Support for public-private partnerships (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); community: Support for public-citizen partnerships (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); coproduce: Willingness to coproduce public services (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); placebo1: Placebo outcome variable for robustness checks (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); placebo2: Placebo outcome variable for robustness checks (0-100; 0=never, 100=always); duration: Time spent on the survey; sex: 0=male; 1=female; white: Race indicator (1=yes, 0=no); black: Race indicator (1=yes, 0=no); hispanic: Race indicator (1=yes, 0=no); asian: Race indicator (1=yes, 0=no); other: Race indicator (1=yes, 0=no); age: Age in years (18-100); income: 1=<25k; 2=25k-34,999; 3=35k-49,999; 4=50k-74,999; 5=75k-99,999; 6=100k-149,999; 7=150k+; education: 1=<high school; 2=high school/GED; 3=some college; 4=2-year degree; 5=4-year degree; 6=master's; 7=doctoral; 8=professional (JD, MD); ideology: 1=very liberal; 2=liberal; 3=moderate; 4=conservative; 5=very conservative; gw: Belief that global warming is happening (-1=no, 0=don't know, 1=yes); gwh: Belief about human causation of global warming (-1=neither, 0=mostly natural, 1=mostly human); covid: Concern about COVID-19 (1=not at all, ..., 5=extremely concerned); covid_job: Concern about job loss due to the pandemic (1=strongly disagree, ..., 5=strongly agree); rand: The randomly assigned government integrity group: Corrupt, Control, and Honest; trustprime: Encoding of government integrity group to which participants are assigned (0=Corrupt, 1=Control, 2=Honest); at: Response to the question, ""What is 17 + 63 equal to?""

Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?,"The data come from the 1980 U.S. Census (Public Use Microdata Samples). The sample includes native-born men ages 40 to 49, corresponding to birth years 1930 through 1939. It provides information on education, weekly earnings, quarter of birth, year of birth, age in quarters, and state of birth. Earnings are constructed from annual income and weeks worked, recorded in logarithmic form. Variables: v1: Age in years at the time of the census; v2: Age in quarters (used for detailed age controls); v4: Years of completed schooling; v5: East North Central division dummy; v6: East South Central division dummy; v9: Log of weekly earnings for workers with positive values; v10: 1 if married with spouse present, 0 otherwise; v11: Mid-Atlantic division dummy; v12: Mountain division dummy; v13: New England division dummy (1 if resident in New England, 0 otherwise); v16: Census year indicator, commonly coded 70 = 1970 and 80 = 1980 in replications; v18: Quarter of birth coded 1-4 (Q4 is the omitted category in models using q1-q3); v19: 1 if White, 0 otherwise (primary analyses restrict to White men); v20: 1 if in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, 0 otherwise; v21: South Atlantic division dummy; v24: West North Central division dummy; v25: West South Central division dummy; v27: Year of birth (1930-1939)",What is the effect of an additional year of schooling on weekly earnings?,0.0769,0.015,1,iv,v4,v9,v18 x v27,,,v18,,0,,,compulsory_school.csv,Table 5,1991,economics,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FENLGZX,,,,,"@article{6fbb1288-4554-32e5-b141-bb1f8b103164,

 abstract = {We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.},

Are Minimum Wages a Silent Killer? New Evidence on Drunk Driving Fatalities,"description
""This dataset is an annual, state-by-year panel for U.S. states combining fatal crash counts, alcohol-related crash measures for young drivers, minimum wage measures, alcohol policy/tax variables, price indices, and population and income controls, assembled to study alcohol-involved traffic outcomes in relation to policy and economic conditions. The crash measures align with the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) conventions on alcohol involvement and timing characteristics, while policy and macro controls capture state minimum wages, beer excise taxes, inflation indexes, and demographic scale and income levels at the state-year level. Variables: tot_acc_all: Total fatal traffic accidents in the state-year, as counted in FARS aggregates for all crash circumstances. DUI_1620: Alcohol-involved fatal accidents or fatalities involving drivers aged 16-20, consistent with FARS alcohol-impaired measures and age-specific tallies; FARS imputes BAC where missing using established methods. nonDUI_1620: Fatal accidents or fatalities for ages 16-20 that are not classified as alcohol-involved under FARS definitions for the same state-year. tot_acc_nt / tot_acc_dt: Fatal accidents occurring at night versus daytime, matching FARS time-of-day categorizations commonly used in alcohol-impaired crash reporting. tot_acc_we / tot_acc_wd: Fatal accidents occurring on weekends versus weekdays, consistent with FARS day-of-week splits used to describe alcohol-involved crash patterns. ur1620_r: Unemployment rate for ages 16-20 in the state-year, expressed as a rate; captures youth labor market conditions relevant to the age group used in the alcohol-involved outcomes. pop: Total state population, annual. pop1620: State population ages 16-20, annual. lpop: Log of total state population, facilitating scale normalization in regression specifications and descriptive summaries. pc_perinc: Per capita personal income (nominal) at the state-year level. lpc_perinc: Log of per capita personal income, providing a scaled income control. cpi: Consumer Price Index level used to convert nominal variables; precise index definition follows the replication package documentation. cpi2006: CPI re-based to a 2006 index (e.g., 2006=100) to align deflation across series within the dataset. mw2: State minimum wage level (nominal), defined as the binding minimum in the state-year (state or federal), consistent with standard minimum wage series used in policy analyses. mwdef: Deflated or standardized minimum wage measure (e.g., real minimum wage using the included CPI), enabling comparisons over time within states. beertax: Nominal beer excise tax per unit (e.g., per gallon) at the state-year level, capturing alcohol price policy; realbeertax: Beer tax adjusted for inflation using the included CPI series for real comparisons across years. bac: Indicator for the state per se blood alcohol concentration (BAC) legal limit regime (e.g., .08 per se), reflecting contemporaneous legal environment for impaired driving enforcement.""",What is the effect of the minimum wage on alcohol-related fatal accidents involving drivers ages 16-20?,0.012,0.011,0,did,mwdef,probit1620,"lnorate1620, lpop, realbeertax, bac, lpc_perinc, ur1620_r",,year,,state,,,,fars.csv,,2019,economics,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2F6AYLVO,,,,,"@article{Sabia_2019,

Can Learning Constituency Opinion Affect How Legislators Vote? Results from a Field Experiment ,"The dataset comes from a field experiment conducted on members of the New Mexico House of Representatives. The House was selected instead of the State Senate to reduce the risk of information spillovers and to take advantage of its larger chamber size. Legislators were organized into 35 matched pairs using four covariates: political party, district-level survey results, re-election status, and the 2004 presidential vote share in their district. Within each pair, one legislator was randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. Treatment legislators received a letter describing their constituents' opinions on a gubernatorial spending proposal involving road projects and tax rebates.

Can Learning Constituency Opinion Affect How Legislators Vote? Results from a Field Experiment ,"The dataset comes from a field experiment conducted on members of the New Mexico House of Representatives. The House was selected instead of the State Senate to reduce the risk of information spillovers and to take advantage of its larger chamber size. Legislators were organized into 35 matched pairs using four covariates: political party, district-level survey results, re-election status, and the 2004 presidential vote share in their district. Within each pair, one legislator was randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. Treatment legislators received a letter describing their constituents' opinions on a gubernatorial spending proposal involving road projects and tax rebates. The letter was mailed and verified as received on the morning the special session began, and the same content was also emailed to the treatment group. The primary outcome was the legislator's recorded vote on the spending bill. The final sample included 67 individuals.

Doing Well by Doing Good: The Impact of Foreign Aid on Foreign Public Opinion,"The dataset combines multinational survey data on public opinion with country-level information on aid flows, health indicators, governance, and economic conditions. Public opinion measures come from the Gallup World Poll (GWP), an annual global survey launched in 2006 that samples individuals aged 15 and older. In countries with high telephone penetration (over 80%), data are collected through Random-Digit-Dial (RDD) telephone interviews; elsewhere, surveys are conducted face-to-face. Each survey includes about 1,000 respondents per country per year. Aid-related data include figures from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one of the largest U.S. bilateral health initiatives, launched in 2003 and first disbursed in 2004, aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in dozens of countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset also incorporates U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) compiled from international aid databases. Additional country-level indicators are drawn from international sources: population and economic statistics from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI), health data from UNAIDS and global monitoring agencies, governance measures from the World Bank Governance Indicators, civil liberties scores from Freedom House, UN General Assembly voting data, and trade flows from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Data variables: country: Country name; ccode: Numeric country code; y_us: Net approval of the U.S. (log(%approve) - log(%disapprove)); y_ch: Net approval of China; y_fr: Net approval of France; y_ge: Net approval of Germany; y_in: Net approval of India; y_ja: Net approval of Japan; y_ru: Net approval of Russia; y_uk: Net approval of the U.K.; y_ownc: Net approval of respondent's own country; x: PEPFAR funds per capita (log); x_imputed: PEPFAR funds per capita (log, imputed); z_ratio: HIV prevalence rate (log); z_death: HIV-related deaths per capita (log); usaid: U.S. ODA per capita (log); usaid_imputed: U.S. ODA per capita (log, imputed); gdppc: GDP per capita (log); wbgi: World Bank governance indicator; fhscore: Freedom House civil liberties score; africa: 1 if African country, 0 otherwise; trade_i: Imports to the U.S. (log); trade_e: Exports to the U.S. (log); unvote_key: UN voting alignment with the U.S.",Does PEPFAR funding increase approval of U.S. leadership?,0.202,0.068,1,iv,x,y_us,"usaid, gdppc, wbgi, fhscore, africa, trade_i, trade_e, unvote_key",,,"z_ratio, z_death",,0,,,goldsmith_2014_impact_of_foreign_aid.csv,Table 1,2014,political science,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IHMFPJ,,,,,,,
Were Newspapers More Interested in pro-Obama Letters to the Editor in 2008? Evidence from a Field Experiment. ,"The dataset comes from an experiment on a sample of 100 U.S. daily newspapers. The initial population was drawn from the 2005 edition of Bacon's Newspaper Directory, which listed 116 newspapers with daily circulations greater than 100,000. This pool was reduced to 100 by excluding outlets that had gone bankrupt, were primarily foreign-language papers, or where submissions failed. In the experiment, each newspaper was randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: a pro-Obama or a pro-McCain letter to the editor. The letters were submitted by email and online forms on October 20-21, 2008. The outcome measure was whether the newspaper expressed interest in publishing the submitted letter. Data variables: source: Newspaper name; circulation: Total daily circulation; opedemail: Contact email for Op-Ed/letters to the editor; website: Link to the newspaper's official website; mccain: Binary treatment indicator, 1 = newspaper was assigned to receive a pro-McCain letter, 0 = pro-Obama letter; extreme: Indicator for whether the submitted letter was coded as ""extreme"" in tone/content; 1 = extreme, 0 = not extreme; deliveryfailure: Indicator for failed delivery; interest_in_letter: Binary variable indicating the newspaper's interest in publishing the letter; 1 if the newspaper either contacted the alias for verification or published the letter, 0 otherwise; endorse: Measure (1-5) of how strongly the newspaper endorsed a presidential candidate (higher values = stronger endorsement); state: U.S. state where the newspaper is published; metro: City or metropolitan area of publication; unemployment_state: State unemployment rate; unemployment_metro: Metropolitan unemployment rate; kerry: 2004 two-party Democratic presidential vote share, state-level; bush: 2004 two-party Republican presidential vote share, state-level; yr_price: Annual subscription price of the newspaper; adprice_sunday: Price of a Sunday advertisement; pop_designated_market: Population of the designated market area or city zone; south: Regional indicator, 1 = newspaper located in the U.S. South, 0 = otherwise",Does receipt of a pro-McCain letter affect a paper's probability of expressing interest in publishing it?,0.58,0.29,1,glm,mccain,interest_in_letter,"circulation, unemployment_metro",,,,,1,,,ButlerSchofield_APR_2010_liberal_media_bias_data.csv,Table 2,2010,political science,CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 US,https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d023,,,Uses probit regression,,,,
Foreign Direct Investors as Agents of Economic Transition: An Instrumental Variables Analysis,"The dataset covers 310 country-year observations from 27 transition economies in post-Soviet Europe between 1994 and 2004. It brings together indicators of institutional reform, foreign direct investment (FDI), political competition, European integration, and macroeconomic conditions to capture the dynamics of post-communist transitions. The institutional measures are drawn from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transition indicators, which track progress on privatization, market liberalization, and structural reforms. Economic data include FDI stocks as a share of GDP, exchange rate movements, and income levels. Political developments are represented through changes in the strength of communist successor parties, constraints on executive power, and the status of relationships with the European Union (EU). The dataset also accounts for conflict conditions to capture the impact of wars on reform trajectories. Data variables: country_: country; year: year in YYYY-MM-DD format; d_EBRD: institutional quality score; l_d_ln_cumfigdp: lagged changes in cumulative FDI as share of GDP; l2_change_predX2a: lagged exchange rate predictions; d_postcomseats: changes in post-communist legislature seats for communist parties; d_polcon3: political constraints; d_eu: EU relationship status; d_ln_gdpcap: GDP per capita, log; wartorn: war indicator (1 = war, 0 = no war)",How do foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows influence the progress of institutional reforms in transition economies?,6.307,4.871,0,iv,l_d_ln_cumfdigdp,d_EBRD,"d_postcomseats, d_polcon3, wartorn, d_eu, d_ln_gdpcap",,,l2_change_predX2a,,0,,,clean_iv_dataset.csv,Table 4,2015,political science,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PDVSW5,,,,Some parts of the data was removed,,,
Timing Is Everything? Primacy and Recency Effects in Voter Mobilization Campaigns ,"The dataset consists of 25,000 registered voters in Rochester, New York, who were part of a randomized field experiment during the November 2005 municipal elections. Voters were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a phone reminder call scheduled for 4 weeks before Election Day, 2 weeks before, 3 days before, or a control group that received no call. The calls were nonpartisan get-out-the-vote reminders, delivered using standardized scripts. The unit of observation is the individual registered voter, and only those appearing on the official registration list were included. The main outcome is voter turnout in the 2005 election, while additional measures capture past voting history, party registration, demographics, and a predicted propensity to vote. The dataset also records whether each assigned reminder call was actually completed, allowing for comparison between group assignment and the reality of who was contacted.

Incumbents Beware: The Impact of Offshoring on Elections,"The dataset tracks municipalities in Spain across multiple election cycles to study the effect of local offshoring events on incumbent vote shares. Offshoring events were identified using corporate balance sheet databases, prior academic compilations, media reports, and public restructuring monitors. Each event was verified through at least two independent sources to ensure accuracy. For every confirmed event, the exact plant location and the number of jobs lost were recorded. These events were then matched with municipality-level election results to capture changes in incumbent party vote shares across elections. Additional contextual variables, such as population, unemployment, and economic growth, were obtained from official regional statistical agencies.

Field Experiments Testing the Impact of Radio Advertisements on Electoral Competition ,"The dataset consists of 49 observations from mayoral elections in U.S. cities, with 33 observations from 2005 and 16 from 2006. The data is gathered through a randomized field experiment. Within matched pairs of municipalities, one city was randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. The treatment involved a 60-second, non-partisan get-out-the-vote radio advertisement. The control group received no such intervention. The unit of observation is the city. Inclusion was limited to cities with populations over 30,000 where an incumbent mayor ran for reelection against an opponent. The study's outcome measure is the change in the incumbent mayor's vote share compared to the previous election. Variables: State: State; City: City; Contested_2006: Mayoral election contested; To_Prev: Turnout in prior mayoral election; Partisan: Partisan ballot; Inc_Voteshare_Prev: Incumbent vote percentage in prior mayoral election; Inc_Running_2006: Incumbent running in mayoral election; Grp_Buy: Gross Ratings Points purchased (measure of advertising intensity); Statewide_2005: Statewide election; Strata90: Low Cost-per-point stratum; Strata70: Moderate Cost-per-point stratum; Votesharechange: Change in incumbent vote percentage since prior mayoral election; Votesharediff: Margin of victory; Year_Exp: Experiment year",What was the effect of the radio advertising campaign on the change in the incumbent mayor's vote share in the 2006 elections?,-0.112,0.136,0,ols,Grp_Buy,Votesharechange,"Strata70, Strata90, Partisan, To_Prev, Statewide_2005",,,,,1,,,PanagopoulosGreen_AJPS_2008_ReplicationDataset.csv,"TABLE 2, 2006, Strata and Covariates column",2008,political science,CC BY-NC-ND 3.0,https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d042,,,,,,,

Does rising income inequality affect mortality rates in advanced economies?,"This dataset aims to study the effect of income inequality on mortality rates for men and women in a subset of OECD countries from 1950 to 2000 using adult mortality rates at age sixty-five as the measure of mortality. Likewise, for measuring income inequality, the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient was used. The coefficient is directly obtained from the World Top Income Database. More specifically, the measure was derived from individual taxation and income data as well as national account statistics. The Pareto-Lorenz coefficient ranges from 1.5 to 3. Values in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 are considered low inequality, while values above 2.5 are considered high inequality. Data variables: year: Year observation was taken; cc: Country code; qxall: Averaged rate between qxfemale and qxmale; qxfemale: Five-year mortality rate for females at age sixty-five (the probability of dying within 5 years for 65-year-old women); invertedplc: Inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient (measure of income inequality at the top end of distribution, ranging from ~1.5-3); exfemale: Life expectancy for females at age 65; qxmale: Five-year mortality rate for males at age sixty-five (the probability of dying within 5 years for 65-year-old men); exmale: Life expectancy for males (at age 65); country: Country name; rgdpe: Real GDP obtained from Penn World Table; values adjusted for purchasing power parity; pop: Population (in millions); hc: Health capital index - a measure capturing educational attainment that serves as a proxy for human capital stock; rpcgdp: Real per capita GDP - GDP per person adjusted for purchasing power parity",Does a greater inequality in income lead to a higher average mortality rate among males and females?,-0.0237,0.01,1,ols,invertedplc,qxall,"pop, hc, rgdpe",,,,,0,,,mortality_income_inequality.csv,Table 3,2017,economics,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/E3X2NO,,,,,"@article{rebeira2017does,

Dismantling the 'Jungle': migrant relocation and extreme voting in France,"This dataset combines municipal-level information from across France to study the political effects of migrant relocation after the dismantling of the Calais ""Jungle"" between 2015 and 2016. Data on temporary migrant reception centers, called Centres d'Accueil et d'Orientation (CAOs), were collected through a combination of systematic searches in local newspapers using Factiva and a publicly released dataset by CIMADE in October 2016. The media search recorded CAO locations and migrant counts reported in articles, while the CIMADE dataset listed 210 centers and their capacities.

The Effect of Microinsurance on Economic Activities: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,"The dataset is the result of a randomized controlled trial conducted to study the effect of insurance on farming behavior. Each village consists of at least one AHW (Animal Husbandry Worker), who is involved in tasks such as animal immunization, providing technical assistance to farmers, etc. As part of the experiment, AHWs are assigned to different incentive schemes associated with the number of sow insurance purchases. In the control group villages, AHWs were offered a reward of 50 yuan to participate. In the low incentive group (LIG), the AHW is offered 20 Yuan to begin with, and an additional payment of 2 Yuan for each insured sow. Finally, in the high incentive group (HIG), the AHWs are offered a starting payment of 20 Yuan and an additional 4 Yuan for each insured sow.

Do Term Limits Restrain State Fiscal Policy? Approaches for Causal Inference in Assessing the Effects of Legislative Institut,"This dataset contains state-level panel data examining fiscal policy outcomes across U.S. states during a period of significant variation in legislative term limits. The data spans multiple decades, capturing the adoption and subsequent repeal of term limits across states. The term limits movement began in 1990 with California, Colorado, and Oklahoma, followed by a major wave in 1992 when eight additional states adopted restrictions. By 2000, twenty-one states had implemented term limits on state legislators. However, several states later repealed these limits through court decisions or legislative action. Currently, fifteen states maintain active term limits while six have repealed previously enacted restrictions.

Does earmarked funding affect the performance of international organisations?,"The dataset compiles performance evaluations of 32 international organizations (IOs) from 2009 to 2021, encompassing 64 assessments conducted by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN). Organizations vary significantly in their funding composition, with some receiving predominantly core contributions that provide operational flexibility, while others rely heavily on earmarked resources that restrict fund usage to specific purposes, sectors, or geographic areas. Due to their specific nature, earmarked funding does not offer flexibility. Thus, there is a possibility that earmarked funding may limit organizational performance. The dataset tracks both short-term and long-term earmarked funding patterns alongside core funding levels. International organizations' performance is given by two metrics: 1) Process performance, the extent to which organizations have rules to plan and manage operations strategically, and 2) outcome performance, which measures the organization's success in achieving desired results. Variables: organization: international organization name; acronym: organization abbreviation; year: assessment year; mopan: The version of MOPAN methodology used in the assessment (one of 3.0, 3.1, or 3.0*, CA = older version); newmopan: Binary variable that is 1 if the new MOPAN assessment methodology was used; y1: process performance factor score; y2: outcome performance factor score; y1n: process performance factor score after removing 2 micro indicators; y2n: outcome performance factor score after removing 2 micro indicators; EMST: earmarked funding share in the year before MOPAN assessment (t-1 year); EMLT: earmarked funding share in the years t-2 and t-3 before MOPAN assessment, i.e., 2 and 3 years before; un: indicator for UN system organizations (1 = UN organization, 0 = non-UN organization); coreSTd: non-core funding amount; coreST: core funding amount; emST: earmarked funding amount; emST_MBI: earmarked funding amount computed by MOPAN; emshareLTd: Share of earmarked funding in the IO budget based on data from UN DESA Data; emshareLTb: Share of earmarked funding in the IO budget based on data from UN Data Cube; emshareLT: Share of earmarked funding share for long-term projects; nproj_lt: number of earmarked projects; ndon_lt: number of donors providing earmarked funding; states_num: number of member states; states_unga_sd: standard deviation of the preferences of the member states with respect to ideal point estimates; tenure: executive head tenure length; selectorate: Variable indicating how the executive is selected (1 = appointed by the chief of parent organization, 2 = selected by the board, 3 = chosen by the assembly of member states); founding: organization founding year; hq: headquarters location; field_presence: number of staff in the field; staff_count: total staff size; normio: indicator for norm-making IOs: FAO, ILO, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, WHO, GEF; lnsectors: logarithm of the number of sectors in which the organization receives donor funding; meanwSIM: weighted mean cosine similarity of sector-specific contribution profile, which is proportional to the total budget of the IOs",How much does earmarked funding share in the preceding year affect the process performance of international organisations?,-1.5,0.71,1,iv,EMST,y1,newmopan,,,meanwSIM,,0,,,MBIPEF_replication.csv,Table 5 (1),2023,economics,CC0 1.0,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OVT16M,,,,,,,
"Cabinets, Committees, and Careers: The Causal Effect of Committee Service","The dataset comes from French parliamentary records across multiple legislative sessions. It is structured by deputy-year, and includes variables for legislative behavior, career success, policy-making, tenure, and constituent characteristics. An interesting feature of the lower house was that the legislature was randomly assigned into 11 groups called bureaux, and each group chose members to serve on the budget committee. The deputies convened with their assigned group, and after hours of discussion, each bureau nominated three representatives to serve on the budget committee. Bureaux was a temporary committee, and the selection was done every year. This random selection of bureaux (or bureau) for budget selection was done from 1894 to 1910, after which it was disbanded.

Improving Balance in Regression Discontinuity Design by Matching: Estimating the Effect of Academic Probation after the First Year of College,"This dataset comprises comprehensive academic records from a large Canadian university system, consisting of one central campus and two smaller satellite campuses. The data tracks 12,530 first-year students who entered the university between the 1996-97 and 2003-04 academic years, with students aged 17-21 at entry. The dataset focuses on students whose academic performance places them near institutional academic standing thresholds, specifically those with first-year GPAs within a range of the university's academic evaluation criteria. Different campuses maintain distinct GPA cutoffs for academic standing assessments, resulting in variations in institutional policies across the university system. Students are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls below the cutoffs. The longitudinal structure captures academic performance across multiple terms and years, including semester and cumulative GPAs, total credits attempted and completed, registration patterns for fall and summer terms, and academic standing determinations. Outcome measures track graduation status at 4, 5, and 6-year intervals, along with probation and suspension incidents.

A Call to Arms: How Rebel Groups Choose Their Recruitment Appeals,"This dataset is a cross-sectional rebel-group-level file that integrates original measures of recruitment appeals from the Rebel Appeals and Incentives Dataset (RAID) with standardized indicators of rebel ideology, organizational features, and country-level context for 232 rebel movements active worldwide between 1989 and 2011. Each record corresponds to a distinct rebel organization and captures both the breadth and composition of its grievance-based recruitment appeals, as well as its ideological profile, strength, territorial control, ethnic composition, and the regime and economic environment in which it operates. Variable descriptions: new_side_b_id: Numeric group identifier that uniquely references each rebel organization in the merged file, harmonizing the RAID units with the underlying non-state actor and replication identifiers used for statistical analysis.​ ccode: Numeric country code indicating the primary state within which the rebel group is active, enabling linkage to country-level democracy and GDP covariates and the clustering of standard errors by conflict country.​ ideol_ord: Ordinal indicator capturing the group’s core ideology type as used in the models (e.g., distinguishing radical Islamist from other ideological families) to operationalize the main explanatory contrast in the paper.​ other_rel_appeals: Dichotomous RAID-based indicator coded 1 if the group sometimes employs recruitment appeals to non-Islamist religious ideologies (e.g., generic religious or non-radical faith-based claims), and 0 otherwise.​ left_appeals: Binary variable denoting whether the group recruits using left-wing or communist ideological appeals, such as references to Marxist principles or anti-capitalist class struggle.​ anti_resource_appeals: Indicator coded 1 when rebel recruitment materials highlight opposition to the exploitation of local resources by external actors, including grievances about plunder or unequal resource extraction.​ gov_violence_appeals: Binary measure for appeals centered on violent government repression and human rights abuses, where recruitment narratives emphasize state-perpetrated killings, torture, or indiscriminate attacks.​ feminist_appeals: Indicator for appeals invoking women’s rights or gender inequality as a recruitment theme, such as mobilizing against gendered exclusion or violence.​ other_appeals: Catch-all binary category capturing miscellaneous recruitment appeals that do not fit the primary ideological or grievance types but nonetheless appear as recurring frames in the group’s propaganda. ethnic_nat_appeals: Dichotomous RAID measure indicating whether the group mobilizes recruits using ethnonationalist or regional grievances, such as discrimination against a specific ethnic community or demands for national self-determination.​ anti_intervention_appeals: Binary indicator coded 1 when groups employ recruitment appeals opposing foreign military intervention or occupation, including denunciations of external troops or international coalitions.​ gov_grievance_appeals: Variable marking general anti-government grievance appeals, where recruitment emphasizes corruption, misrule, or broad political injustices without being limited to a single policy issue.​ multi_ethnic: Dichotomous measure from RAID indicating whether the group’s membership is multi-ethnic, capturing heterogeneity in the ethnic background of recruits rather than whether ethnicity is the explicit basis of mobilization.​ secessionist: Binary indicator of whether the organization has secessionist aims, that is, whether it seeks to create an independent state separate from the existing central government.​ reb_strength_ord: Ordinal measure of relative rebel strength taken from the NSA dataset, capturing expert assessments of whether the group is weaker, roughly equal, or stronger relative to government forces.​ name: Text string with the full or commonly used name of the rebel organization, preserving interpretable labels alongside numeric identifiers for substantive interpretation and replication.​ multi_appeals: Binary summary indicator coded 1 if the group uses two or more distinct recruitment appeals (across the RAID dimensions), operationalizing whether recruitment is diversified versus narrow.​ terr_cont: Dichotomous measure for whether the group controls territory at any point, indicating de facto governance or sustained physical control of areas as captured in the NSA data.​ any_nr_binary: Indicator for whether the group exploited any natural resources (e.g., lootable or extractive commodities) during its life, derived from the Rebel Contraband Dataset and collapsed into a yes/no measure.​ appeals_count: Count variable measuring the total number of distinct recruitment appeals coded for the group across the RAID dimensions, ranging from 0 (no grievance-based appeals, only material incentives) to higher values for groups with more diverse appeals.​ other_group_binary: Binary measure capturing whether another rebel group was present in the same country when this group entered the armed conflict dataset, providing a simple indicator of inter-rebel competition.​ left_wing: Dichotomous indicator (from WARD/FORGE) for whether the organization has a communist or broader left-wing founding ideology, used both as a control and for constructing alternative measures of ideological diversity.​ supporttype_funds_rebel: Binary variable indicating whether the group received financial support from external actors (e.g., state sponsors or foreign patrons), based on external support data on rebel funding.​ radical_islamist: Core binary explanatory variable coded 1 for groups with a radical Islamist ideology—those espousing goals such as establishing an Islamic state, enforcing religious law, or defending Islam—and 0 otherwise.​ foreign_f: Dichotomous indicator of whether the group recruits foreign fighters, based on external foreign-fighter datasets and used to test how internationalization of recruitment conditions appeal diversity.​ v2x_polyarchy: Continuous country-level democracy score (polyarchy index) for the group’s main country, capturing the extent of electoral competition and participation and serving as a control for regime type.​ mean_log10_gdp_pc: Continuous measure of average logged GDP per capita in the group’s host country over its active period, capturing income levels and included as a macroeconomic control.​ group_age: Numeric variable measuring the age or duration of the group (e.g., years active), used as a control to account for the possibility that older organizations have had more time to diversify appeals.​ ideology_forge_count: Count of the number of distinct founding ideologies attributed to the group in the FORGE dataset (e.g., religious, nationalist, left-wing), used in robustness checks on broader ideological diversity.​ incompatible_appeals: Binary measure constructed by examining all pairwise correlations among appeals in RAID and coding 1 if the group employs at least one pair of appeals that are negatively and significantly associated in the full sample, indicating that it combines appeals most groups avoid mixing.​ post_2003: Dichotomous indicator taking value 1 for groups active after 2003, capturing the post–Iraq invasion period in which transnational jihadist dynamics and perceptions of threats to Islam intensified.​ ideology_count: Count variable summarizing the number of ideologies a group represents across external ideology datasets (e.g., socialism, Islamism, nationalism), used in robustness checks on ideological diversification beyond recruitment appeals.​ appeals_count_restrict: Alternative, more restrictive count of recruitment appeals that excludes appeals corresponding to the group’s parent ideology (e.g., omitting Islamist appeals for Islamist groups), used to test whether results hold when focusing on “non-core” grievances.​ multi_appeals_restrict: Binary version of the restrictive count, coded 1 if the group makes two or more non-parent appeals, allowing analyses of diversified grievance framing net of primary ideology.​ year_start: Calendar year in which the group first appears in the armed conflict or non-state actor data, anchoring the onset of its conflict activity and the period over which contextual covariates are averaged or coded.​ year_end: Calendar year in which the group exits the dataset (e.g., due to dissolution, defeat, or end of recorded activity), marking the end of its observed life span for the purposes of computing group age and averaging country-level variables.​",Does being a radical Islamist group causally increase the number of recruitment appeals they
