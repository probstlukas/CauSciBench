QRData,"Three social scientists conducted an RCT in which they investigated whether social pressure within neighborhoods increases participation. Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States. The GOTV message of particular interest was designed to induce social pressure by telling voters that after the election, their neighbors would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not. The researchers hypothesized that such a naming and shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation. There are three treatment groups: Civic Duty, Hawthorne, and Neighbors. The Civic Duty group gets a message saying voting is their civic duty. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. Finally, the Neighbors group receives a message saying that the neighbors can become aware of whether they voted or not. The experiment also has a control group (Control), which consists of voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups (3 types of treatment and 1 control) and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.

QRData,"Three social scientists conducted an RCT in which they investigated whether social pressure within neighborhoods increases participation. Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States. The GOTV message of particular interest was designed to induce social pressure by telling voters that after the election, their neighbors would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not. The researchers hypothesized that such a naming and shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation. There are three treatment groups: Civic Duty, Hawthorne, and Neighbors. The Civic Duty group gets a message saying voting is their civic duty. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. Finally, the Neighbors group receives a message saying that the neighbors can become aware of whether they voted or not. The experiment also has a control group (Control), which consists of voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups (3 types of treatment and 1 control) and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.
