        "dataset_description": "This dataset contains administrative records from the state of Washington related to driving under the influence (DUI) incidents. Washington State uniformly enforced a legal BAC limit of 0.08 for DUI offenses. The BAC values are obtained from tests conducted by the state police using breathalyzers. Drivers under the legal drinking age were excluded from the analysis, as they are subject to different legal standards. Besides BAC values, the dataset includes demographic information about the driver and recidivism, which indicates if the person was charged with a DUI offense again. Variables: date: date when the BAC test occurred; alcohol1: alcohol level from the first test; alcohol2: alcohol level from the second test; low_score: lower score between alcohol1 and alcohol2; male: indicator for the driver's gender; 1 if male, 0 otherwise; white: indicator for the driver's race; 1 if white, 0 otherwise; recidivism: indicator for whether the driver was stopped again for suspected DUI within a specified follow-up period; 1 if yes, 0 if no; acc: indicator for whether the original DUI stop involved a vehicle accident; 1 if yes, 0 if no; age: age of the driver at the time of the DUI stop; year: calendar year in which the DUI stop occurred; bac1: BAC value at the time of the test",

Public opinion measures come from the Gallup World Poll (GWP), an annual global survey launched in 2006 that samples individuals aged 15 and older. In countries with high telephone penetration (over 80%), data are collected through Random-Digit-Dial (RDD) telephone interviews; elsewhere, surveys are conducted face-to-face. Each survey includes about 1,000 respondents per country per year. Aid-related data include figures from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one of the largest U.S. bilateral health initiatives, launched in 2003 and first disbursed in 2004, aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in dozens of countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset also incorporates U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) compiled from international aid databases. Additional country-level indicators are drawn from international sources: population and economic statistics from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI), health data from UNAIDS and global monitoring agencies, governance measures from the World Bank Governance Indicators, civil liberties scores from Freedom House, UN General Assembly voting data, and trade flows from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

This pool was reduced to 100 by excluding outlets that had gone bankrupt, were primarily foreign-language papers, or where submissions failed. In the experiment, each newspaper was randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: a pro-Obama or a pro-McCain letter to the editor. The letters were submitted by email and online forms on October 20-21, 2008. The outcome measure was whether the newspaper expressed interest in publishing the submitted letter.

The institutional measures are drawn from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transition indicators, which track progress on privatization, market liberalization, and structural reforms. Economic data include FDI stocks as a share of GDP, exchange rate movements, and income levels. Political developments are represented through changes in the strength of communist successor parties, constraints on executive power, and the status of relationships with the European Union (EU). The dataset also accounts for conflict conditions to capture the impact of wars on reform trajectories.

        "dataset_description": "This dataset comes from an online survey experiment conducted in the United States on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,200 adult participants were included after excluding incomplete responses and failed manipulation checks. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group where the virus was labeled COVID-19 and a treatment group where it was labeled the \"Chinese Virus\". The goal of the experiment was to test whether these labels influenced attitudes toward Chinese immigrants and shifted blame toward or away from the federal government. To capture sensitive views, the design combined a list experiment with direct survey questions.

        "dataset_description": "This dataset combines municipal-level information from across France to study the political effects of migrant relocation after the dismantling of the Calais \"Jungle\" between 2015 and 2016. Data on temporary migrant reception centers, called Centres d'Accueil et d'Orientation (CAOs), were collected through a combination of systematic searches in local newspapers using Factiva and a publicly released dataset by CIMADE in October 2016. The media search recorded CAO locations and migrant counts reported in articles, while the CIMADE dataset listed 210 centers and their capacities. By merging these two sources, the final dataset includes 349 CAOs, closely matching the official government count of 365 centers. CAO capacity was measured either using the maximum number of migrants reported in media articles or the number of beds provided in the CIMADE dataset.

Organizations vary significantly in their funding composition, with some receiving predominantly core contributions that provide operational flexibility, while others rely heavily on earmarked resources that restrict fund usage to specific purposes, sectors, or geographic areas. Due to their specific nature, earmarked funding does not offer flexibility. Thus, there is a possibility that earmarked funding may limit organizational performance. The dataset tracks both short-term and long-term earmarked funding patterns alongside core funding levels. International organizations' performance is given by two metrics: 1) Process performance, the extent to which organizations have rules to plan and manage operations strategically, and 2) outcome performance, which measures the organization's success in achieving desired results.

The data tracks 12,530 first-year students who entered the university between the 1996-97 and 2003-04 academic years, with students aged 17-21 at entry. The dataset focuses on students whose academic performance places them near institutional academic standing thresholds, specifically those with first-year GPAs within a range of the university's academic evaluation criteria. Different campuses maintain distinct GPA cutoffs for academic standing assessments, resulting in variations in institutional policies across the university system. Students are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls below the cutoffs. The longitudinal structure captures academic performance across multiple terms and years, including semester and cumulative GPAs, total credits attempted and completed, registration patterns for fall and summer terms, and academic standing determinations. Outcome measures track graduation status at 4, 5, and 6-year intervals, along with probation and suspension incidents.

A total of 36 polling stations were sampled to reflect comparable socio-economic conditions. Participants were recruited using gender and age quotas, with the questionnaire tailored to their voting method. Additional information came from election workers and independent observers. The study assessed voter confidence in the process, views on secrecy and transparency, ease and speed of voting, poll worker qualifications, and preferences for electronic versus traditional voting\u00d1particularly within Argentina's split-ticket system. To facilitate interpretation, ordinal responses were recoded into binary indicators distinguishing positive from negative experiences across key outcomes: satisfaction, poll worker competence, ease and speed, candidate selection, confidence in counting, secrecy, and perceived election integrity.
